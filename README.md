## Synopsis
For this project, we are going to work on developing some muscle memory building out React components. At this point you’ve built at least one basic React app in the past. Now’s the time to leverage that and add some complexity.

For this project, we will be hitting The Star Wars API to tap into a “black hole” of Star Wars data. Mwahaha.


## Built With
* React
* JQuery
* CSS
* HTML

## Original Assignment - Turing MOD3

* Get comfortable whipping together React components on your own with the additional complexity of implementing React Router (if you want to).

* Write squeaky clean, well refactored code using ES6 syntax.

* Make informed design decisions to create a user-friendly application.

* Keep state based components to a minimum and leverage more functional components.

* Use a modular architecture for your application file structure.

* Think deeply about React Lifecycle Methods.

* Use propTypes for every component receiving props.

#### Specifications

* When a user clicks on People, the page is populated with cards with data for each person.
* The cards should have:
  * Name
  * Homeworld
  * Species
  * Population of Homeworld
  * A button to “Favorite” the person

* The button should have an active class indicating it has been pressed.

* When a user clicks on any of the other buttons, the data should then represent the button pressed.

* Planet Cards:
  * Name
  * Terrain
  * Population
  * Climate
  * Residents
  * A button to “Favorite” the planet

* Vehicle Cards:
  * Name
  * Model
  * Class
  * Number of Passengers

* There should be a button on each card to save it to Favorites.
